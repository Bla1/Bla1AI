Bla1AI
======
Bla1AI, a basic AI that is programmed to make a certain number of cons from a fac, then spam raiders.
Currently cannot go above t1, cannot play metal maps or water maps.
Can use nanos. Will do something on nometal maps, but far from playing a decent game.
To install, go to springfiles and search Bla1AI, then extract the downloaded folder into Spring/AI

Also, I'm still learning how to use github...
