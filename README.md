Bla1AI
======
Bla1AI is an AI written purely in Java. It expands quickly in the early game, making no
defenses but becomes very aggressive once its economy picks up.
Currently cannot go above t1, cannot play metal maps or water maps.
Can use nanos. Will do something on nometal maps, but far from playing a decent game.
To install, go to springfiles and search Bla1AI, then extract the downloaded folder into Spring/AI

The code is quite messy because I have worked on this project on and off.
